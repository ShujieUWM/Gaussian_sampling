# Gaussian_sampling
Gaussian sampling includes my coding practice for sampling from Gaussian distribution
I tried to use MCMC methods to sample from a designed Gaussian distribution.

HD_Gibbs.ipynb--the code of Gibbs methods 

markov_gaussian_hd_v2.py -- the code of normal MCMC methods with a uniform proposal distribution.
